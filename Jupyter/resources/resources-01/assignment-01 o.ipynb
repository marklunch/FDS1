In order to test our methodology, we will also compare works by the same authors: if our analysis shows a large difference there, our methodoloy is maybe not suited to distinguish between authors but only betweent <i>texts</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Mathematical background</h2>\n",

    "  \\#_6( \\{1,1,2,3,5,5,5\\} ) = 0\n",

    "  |A| := \\sum_{s \\in A} \\#_s(A)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if our two multi-sets happen to be sets (so no member appears more than once), then\n",
